##GameHub
###A plaza for all things gaming related,find a list of popular games,with the choice of adding them to your personal game list to recommend for friends and to keep track of the games you played and completed.You start off at the landing page,where you will see a search bar.Typing in your favortite game will re-direct you to another page where a list of your game will show.

####I encountered a few problems,namely with API calling(CORS),a few tweaks with CSS and animation with div placements.To solve these problems I used a heroku proxy that Brian hosted(Instructor) and used his server to connect with my API server.


####I am proud of this project although I could not get all the functionality I wanted.I am glad I used gifs as background images to give the website a pop and the flicker animation to give the website a retro game theme to it.
